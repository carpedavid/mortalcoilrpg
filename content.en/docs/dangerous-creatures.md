# Creature tags and notes

- `Cosmic` creatures can cross planar boundaries at will.
- `Incorporeal` creatures lack physical form and are comprised solely of dark energy. They are immune to physical `damage`.
- `Mindless` creatures lack the capacity to learn, plan, and make decisions. When under someone’s control, they can follow basic instructions but interpret them literally. They automatically fail any save to avoid becoming `enthralled`.
- `Negative` creatures are native to the Negaverse. Their motives are often inscrutable but are rarely good for living creatures.
- `Relentless` creatures attack without care for their own safety.
- `Thrall` indicates that a creature can be `enthralled` by a necromancer.
- `Undead` creatures are the bodies and spirits of previously living creatures which are animated by the dark energy of the Negaverse. They do not need to breathe, eat, or sleep to continue existing, though many of them have an overwhelming desire for human flesh.

# Creatures

Some creatures have customized fallout for when a target suffers from `critical stress`. When a character would normally roll for `fallout` as a result of this creature's attack, they take the effect tagged as fallout instead.

When damage or stress is described, the notation `dX+dY` means to roll both dice and keep the *highest result*. This applies even across types. For example `dX damage + dY stress` means that a victim receives *either* damage *or* stress, depending on which roll was greater.

## Gashadokuro

*Chattering teeth. Rattling bones. Hundreds of bodies tall.*

12 HP, 3 Armor, 16 STR, 10 DEX, 10 CTRL

`Thrall`, `undead`

- **Enormous skeletal hands** (d12+d12 damage)
- **Critical damage**: target is eaten by the gashadokuro.

Colossal skeletons that form spontaneously from the collected remains of fallen soldiers and famine victims. They are motivated by spite toward the living and, while they require no food, they take great pleasure in eating humans.

Gashadokuro can be created via `fleshcrafting`. Building one requires one hundred intact skeletons and takes a month. Once created, it is automatically under your control.

## Geist

*Sour smell of body odor. Hacking cough. Maniacal laugh.*

1 HP, 0 Stability, 10 STR, 12 DEX, 14 CTRL

`Incorporeal`, `undead`

- **Bear hug** (d6 stress)
- **Frightening**: upon seeing a geist for the first time, foes must make a `CTRL save` or be paralyzed and unable to act until it leaves their line of sight or attacks.

A geist is the trapped spirit of a human who was too cruel or dangerous for the Negaverse to absorb. They take great pleasure in toying with their victims and feed on fear.

They appear as tall, dark, shadowy figures with glowing yellow eyes. They can manifest various appendages and body parts as needed.

Every geist has one fear of its own which can be used to repel it once known. Roll `d66` to use the following table for inspiration.

| Die | 1 2       | 3 4             | 5 6              |
| --- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| 1   | Dogs      | Loud noises     | Water            |
| 2   | Dolls     | Mushrooms       | Blood            |
| 3   | Fire      | Power tools     | Mirrors          |
| 4   | Holes     | Enclosed spaces | Flowers          |
| 5   | Snakes    | Needles         | Cats             |
| 6   | Starlight | Spiders         | A specific color |

## Ghoul

*Rotting teeth. Distended belly. Stench of decaying flesh.*

6 HP, 0 Armor, 14 STR, 10 DEX, 3 CTRL

`Relentless`, `thrall`, `undead`

- **Claws and bite** (d8+d6 damage)
- **Critical damage**: target is `paralyzed`. Fatal after one day if the victim does not receive medical treatment.

Ghouls are a grotesque embodiment of greed and gluttony – they are driven by an all-consuming hunger for human flesh. They prefer luring victims to their untimely deaths but will resort to digging up old graves if they can't get a fresh meal.

Ghouls can be created from zombies via `fleshcrafting`.

What's the ghoul chewing on? Choose or roll `2d6`.

| Die | 1 2          | 3 4     | 5 6        |
| --- | ------------ | ------- | ---------- |
| 1   | femur        | thigh   | heart      |
| 2   | skull        | face    | stomach    |
| 3   | humerus      | fingers | liver      |
| 4   | ribs         | shin    | brain      |
| 5   | tibia/fibula | forearm | intestines |
| 6   | ulna/radius  | toes    | lungs      |

## Honebito

*Rotting, fetid, maggot-ridden, and absolutely irresistible.*

3 HP, 0 Armor, 10 STR, 8 DEX, 14 CTRL

`Undead`

- **Draining kiss** (1d4 stress)
- **Beguile**: One target must make a `CTRL save` or become `beguiled`, as per the spell. They perceive the honebito as the most beautiful person they've ever seen.

While some undead are trapped in the physical world by anger or hatred, honebito are motivated by an all-consuming lust. They project a powerful illusion of beauty and vitality which enable them to seduce the living. They then slowly drain their victims' life force, leaving behind nothing more than a shriveled husk.

## Onryō

*Black eyes punctuate an expression of utter contempt.

8 HP, 1 Stability, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 15 CTRL

`Incorporeal`, `undead`

- **Cold touch** (d8 stress)
- **Hex**: One target must make a `CTRL save` or become `hexed`, as per the spell.

Onryō are spirits of the deceased who have been trapped in the physical world by their intense emotions — typically jealousy, rage, or hatred. Unlike most trapped spirits, onryō are motivated only by the desire to hurt others and can never be placated. While they are often powerful enough to kill outright, most prefer to antagonize their victims over time — they enjoy watching the living suffer.

An onryō’s appearance clearly betrays the cause of how they died. Roll `d66` or choose a column and roll `1d6`.

| Die | 1 2 Murder      | 3 4 Suicide | 5 6 Accident      |
| --- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | Shot (torso)    | Shot        | Poisoned          |
| 2   | Shot (head)     | Hung        | Fell              |
| 3   | Stabbed (torso) | Poisoned    | Crashed (vehicle) |
| 4   | Stabbed (head)  | Stabbed     | Suffocated        |
| 5   | Beaten          | Fell        | Burned            |
| 6   | Strangled       | Drowned     | Drowned           |

## Shadow

*Moving, whispering nothingness.*

3 HP, 0 Stability, 8 STR, 10 DEX, 14 CTRL

`Incorporeal`, `negative`

- **Draining touch** (d6 stress)
- **Mute** (`fallout`): Your body loses all color and, no matter how loudly you yell, your voice permanently becomes a whisper. You can no longer be detected or recorded by electronic devices.

Shadows are animated wisps of negative energy that exist only to drain the world of vitality. They are commonly found in areas plagued by war, famine, or disease.

## Skeleton

*Animated bone and sinew, held together by dark magic and luck.*

5 HP, 0 Armor, 6 STR, 13 DEX, 3 CTRL

`Mindless`, `relentless`, `thrall`, `undead`

- **Bony fists** (d4 damage)
- **Drafty**: as they're made of bone and air, skeletons are very difficult to damage. All attacks against skeletons are `impaired`, except for blast attacks, which are `enhanced`.

While animating a zombie requires a fresh, intact corpse, you can create a skeleton from old and even partial corpses. They're less useful and more fragile than a zombie, and they can't be improved or repaired via `fleshcrafting`, but sometimes you have to take what you can get.

## Smiling man

*Wild eyes, maniacal grin, and a piercing laugh.*

3 HP, 0 Stability, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 16 CTRL

`Incorporeal`, `negative`

- **Improvised weapon** (d6 damage)
- **Possession**: One target must make a `CTRL save` or be `possessed`.

A smiling man is a dark spirit that `possesses` the living and compels them to kill. The possessed person begins to act with wild abandon and can’t help but smile and laugh when they inflict pain upon others.

Anyone that kills a person currently inhabited by a smiling man must make a `CTRL save`, or become the next one possessed.

## Wight

*Eyes black as pitch and a smile that cuts like a knife.*

12 HP, 3 Armor, 16 STR, 8 DEX, 12 CTRL

`Thrall`, `undead`

- **Proton rifle** (d8 damage)
- **Frightening**: upon seeing a wight for the first time, all foes must make a `CTRL save` or be paralyzed and unable to act until the wight leaves their line of sight or attacks.

Wights are cold and calculating — animated by the cruelest spirits of the Negaverse. They can follow complex orders and they crave nothing other than imposing their power on others.

Wights can be created from ghouls via `fleshcrafting`.

## Wraith

*Reality turned inside out. The void incarnate.*

18 HP, 3 Stability, 10 STR, 10 DEX, 18 CTRL

`Cosmic`, `incorporeal`, `negative`

- **Withering touch** (d12+d12 stress)
- **Undying**: if a wraith’s physical form is ever destroyed, it reforms out of negative energy `1d6` weeks later in a location of its choice.
- **Conduit** (`fallout`): the wraith uses you as a conduit into the physical world. It can now see through your eyes and hear through your ears. It knows everything that you know and you know that it knows what you know. Roll `2d6`. If it is higher than your current `HP`, take the new result.

Wraiths are the most powerful denizens of the Negaverse short of the Great Gaping Maw. Their schemes span eons and cross multiple realities. They are cruel, cunning, and utterly merciless.

Every wraith is accompanied by distinctive auditory and visual phenomena as a result of the physical universe recoiling from their presence. Roll `1d6` twice or use the following table as inspiration to make each wraith's phenomena unique.

| 1d6 | Visual                      | Auditory                  |
| --- | --------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 1   | Crackling black electricity | Hiss of static            |
| 2   | Flickering dark flame       | Crying infants            |
| 3   | Swirling black smoke        | Fingernails on chalkboard |
| 4   | Dancing motes of darkness   | Screaming children        |
| 5   | Flashes of black rainbows   | Ringing ears              |
| 6   | Mesmerizing moiré pattern   | Buzz of hornets           |

## Yūrei

*Translucent — faintly visible. Disheveled. Arms hang limp.*

6 HP, 0 Stability, 10 STR, 14 DEX, 12 CTRL

`Incorporeal`, `undead`

- **Cold touch** (d4 stress)

Yūrei are spirits of the deceased who have become trapped in the physical world because they feel that something has been left unfinished. They will haunt a person or place until they can be put to rest. Roll `d66` or choose their unfinished business.

## Zombie

*Dead eyes. Stiff gait. Uncanny lack of respiration.*

6 HP, 0 Armor, 10 STR, 6 DEX, 3 CTRL

`Mindless`, `relentless`, `thrall`, `undead`

- **Bite** (d6 damage)

The most striking thing about zombies is how human they look. Even as they deteriorate, dripping blood and trailing torn flesh, even as they grab you with their cold, stiff arms, they still look like someone you might have known – maybe even loved.

Unless directed otherwise, zombies mindlessly attack any living creature that comes near them.
