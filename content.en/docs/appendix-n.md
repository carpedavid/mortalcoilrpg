# Appendix N

## Inspirations

*This Mortal Coil* is inspired by a life-long diet of horror, sci-fi, and other speculative fiction. Specifically, though, the idea of a necromantic space horror game crystalized when I watched Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness for the first time. During one memorable sequence, Dr. Strange possesses a corpse, and the way it was filmed and the action played out made me think, "Wow, I want to play that game."

So I wrote it.

During the writing process, of course, I incorporated influences from a multitude of talented creators and amazing creations. If you tilt your head and squint hard enough, you might recognize some of them.

* **Authors**: Clive Barker, Ray Bradbury, Harlan Ellison
* **Movies**: The Black Hole, Event Horizon, Hellraiser, The Ring, The Grudge
* **RPGs**: Chill, Death in Space, MÃ¶rk Borg, Mothership
* **Music**: Aphex Twin, Autechre, Nine Inch Nails, Orbital, Tool
