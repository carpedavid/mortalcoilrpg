# Malevolent objects

Relics are items imbued with a magical power that can be used by anyone. They usually have a limited use and a process used to recharge them.

## Eye of Nohr

*A fashionable monocle crafted from smoked ochre glass and a titanium frame encircled with spikes.*

When viewing the world though this monocle, you see creatures and objects tainted by the Negaverse outlined in eye-searing, impossible-to-miss, primary yellow. The rest of the world takes on shades of gray.

## Ghost inksticks

*A glittering, black ingot filled with wonder and terror.*

Ghost inksticks are produced by mixing powdered black rock, bloodmeal, and animal glue to produce a dough that is kneaded by hand and pressed into molds to dry. To use, the inkstick is ground against an inkstone, mixed with water, and then applied by brush.

Ghost ink enables a calligrapher to communicate directly with the spirits of the Negaverse.

## Parasitic shadow

*Everything seems normal until you see your shadow move of its own accord.*

You don't feel anything when this unliving creature eats your shadow and takes its place -- not physically, at least -- but you can *hear* it, whispering in your head. If you keep it comfortable and well fed, by providing it with darkness and shadows aplenty, then it will accede to most reasonable requests. It can move in ways no true shadow can move, squeeze through openings as thin as a sheet of paper, manipulate objects weighing less than a feather, and report what it is able to observe through vision and touch.

## Puzzle box

*A fist-sized cube intricately inlaid with bone and gold. It feels warm and comforting in the hand.*

A relic of dubious provenance, this puzzle box has confounded occultists, treasure hunters, and puzzle makers for decades. You're going to want to open it. You shouldn’t, but you're going to want to anyway.

When you achieve the peak of your obsession, unable to think about anything but solving the puzzle, it will open and a wraith will appear. You may negotiate one favor in return for a price you’re probably not willing to pay.

**Recharge**: hand the box to someone else likely to become obsessed with it.

## Talking skull

*A human skull, carved from a solid block of crimson stone.*

It’s a skull that talks. It claims to know everything, but its answers are vacuous, incoherent, and self-aggrandizing. The first time you ask it a question, it tells you its name, but as with everything else it says, its veracity is unclear.

Once you form a rapport with the talking skull, you'll find that it begins to reveal information that it should have no access to. How you determine what information to trust and what to ignore is up to you.
