# Creating a character

> Tell me — what brings you out this way, spacefarer? What makes you tick? We're going to spend an awful lot of time together — you, me, all of your friends, some of your enemies — so we might as well get to know each other, don't you think?

To create a character, first choose a `background` and `homeworld`, fill in your personal details, and choose your starting `equipment`. Second, collaborate with your fellow crew members to build the relationships between your characters.

# Backgrounds

Before you were a beginning necromancer, you lived another life, developed other skills, and had other relationships. Roll `1d6` or choose from the following backgrounds, and then roll `1d6` or choose again to determine a specific goal that you were pursuing when you were offered the chance for eternal life.

# Homeworld

The stellar system, Alfajiri, was first discovered and settled by East Africa Stellar Engineering, one of the largest terraforming and orbital infrastructure conglomerates of the 22nd century. The colony ship, Ushindi, carried just over one hundred thousand engineers, scientists, politicians, artists, and farmers.

Three thousand years later, humans have spread throughout the system. Roll `1d12` or choose what part of the system you come from:

| **1d12** | **Homeworld** |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1        | Maono         |
| 2 3      | Almasi        |
| 4        | Jangwa        |
| 5 6      | Msituni       |
| 7        | Barafu        |
| 8 9 10   | Nyumbani      |
| 11       | Mwewe         |
| 12       | Kivuli        |

The inner planets are those within twelve astronomical units (AU) of the star Alfajiri. Beyond Kivuli, the last of the inner planets, are four giant planets which are still largely unexplored and uninhabited. The outer planets orbit between twenty and one hundred twenty AU away from the center of the system.

**Maono** is the jump gate that connects the Alfajiri system with the rest of the Terran Republic. It is the largest trading hub in the system and is also the seat of the Alfajiri System Leadership Council. Its cosmopolitan residents favor biological enhancements over technological implants.

**Almasi** is a massive mining and refining station. Its half-billion residents are predominately laborers. They favor technological implants over biological enhancements.

**Jangwa** is a dry and mountainous rocky planet. With a thin atmosphere and sparse resources, Jangwa attracts those who value isolation and self-sufficiency.

**Msituni** is a terrestrial planet with crystal clear oceans, lush jungles and forests, and massive amounts of volcanic and tectonic activity. It is the second most populated planet, at a little under one billion humans.

**Barafu** is an ice-covered moon with small settlements powered by geothermal energy. It has become a popular destination for explorers and thrill seekers.

**Nyumbani** is the most Earth-like of the planets in the Alfajiri system and is also the most populous at over ten billion people. Every culture found on Earth can be found on Nyumbani.

**Mwewe** is a human-built moon of Malaika, a carbon planet, which is uninhabitable. They refine hydrocarbons collected from the vast oceans of tar and methane that cover the surface of Malaika. Most of Mwewe's hundred-million residents work in the refineries.

**Kivuli**, the dark planet, orbits well outside the habitable zone. It is home to observatories, research stations, and exploration base camps. It is the primary trading hub for the outer planets.

# Details

Next, fill in a few pertinent details.

1. Choose your name and pronouns.
2. Based on your homeworld, pick a style of clothing and a physical description.
3. Choose your age or roll `2d20+16`.

## Ability scores

You have three `ability scores` that represent your ability to withstand the various challenges that you'll encounter on your quest for immortality.

- `STR` — Strength represents your physicality, brawn, and toughness.
- `DEX` — Dexterity represents your speed, ability to sneak, and hand-eye coordination.
- `CTRL` — Control represents your willpower, strength of personality, and ability to tolerate the unknown.

Roll `3d6` for each of your ability scores, in order. You may choose to swap any two of the results.

## Hit protection

Roll `1d6` to determine your starting `HP`. Hit protection does not measure your health but reflects your ability to avoid `damage` and `stress` — both of which will reduce your HP and then affect your ability scores. HP can be recovered after a few moments rest.

## Inventory slots + starting gear

You have a total of ten `inventory slots` that represent a backpack or bag (six slots) and your hands and upper body (four slots). Most items take up one slot. Small items can be bundled together into one slot. Bulky items take two slots and are awkward to carry, often requiring two hands.

You begin with the gear specified by your background. In addition, the equipment chapter contains a wide selection of weapons, armor, and adventuring gear for you to choose from. When you're in close proximity to civilization, you generally have easy access to any common items that you might need.

## The voice

Everyone hears the voice differently. You know the one — the one that whispers in your ear, tells you things you shouldn't know, and offers to teach you the dark arts — that one. What does yours sound like? Is it human? Artificial? Gendered? Does it speak with an accent? Do you hear words, see images, or simply feel it nudging you slowly down the path of darkness?

When did you first hear the voice? Roll `1d6`, choose, or create your own triggering event.

1. You were physically attacked.
2. Your loved one suddenly passed away.
3. You witnessed an unspeakable act of violence.
4. You contracted a debilitating illness.
5. Your most closely held secret was publicly revealed.
6. Your financial accounts were hacked.

## Fetish

Roll `d66`, choose, or create your `fetish`, an object that has special meaning and which is the source of your magical power. You can never lose it or have it forcefully removed — it will always reappear in your hand — but you can willingly give it away, severing your connection to the Negaverse forever.

Roll `d66` three additional times to determine the symbolic ingredients you'll need to create your `anchor`. Unlike your fetish, these items can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

1. length of rope, frayed and broken
2. straight razor, stained with blood
3. bottle of pills, empty
4. bullet casing, slightly warm to the touch
5. keycard, grants access to the roof of a tall building
6. train ticket, unused
7. rat skull, squeaks happily when held
8. shark's tooth, smells of the sea
9. dog collar, floats around excitedly if left unattended
10. rabbit's foot, twitches occasionally
11. horse shoe, well worn
12. feather, immune to gravity
13. hologram, someone you know very well
14. engraved locket, initials of someone you've never met
15. book of poems, well-read
16. hymnal, mint condition
17. bottle of perfume, half used
18. satchel, floral potpourri
19. wooden animal, hand-carved
20. child's doll, hand-sewn
21. porcelain figurine, dancer
22. bronze statuette, hunter
23. crystal pendant, bird
24. figurine of an unknown animal, bone
25. pocket watch, perpetually wound
26. fountain pen, blood red ink
27. lighter, eternally fueled
28. notebook, black
29. pocket knife, sharp
30. paperweight, onyx pyramid
31. trumpet, only plays  jazz
32. pair of headphones, kickin' bass
33. guitar, tuned perfectly
34. violin, golden
35. drum, skin of dubious provenance
36. harmonica, plays itself

# Your crew

Finally, describe your team and your ship.

## Disposition + relationships

First, roll `2d6` or choose a starting disposition for your crew.

| **2d6** | **Disposition** |
| ------- | --------------- |
| 2       | Dysfunctional   |
| 3-5     | Wary            |
| 6-8     | Comfortable     |
| 9-11    | Friendly        |
| 12      | Tight           |

Next, choose one of the other characters, then roll `1d6` or choose one of the following options:

1. You see them as **your closest friend**. They get to decide how your friendship came about and how close they feel to you.
2. You **owe them a debt** of some significance. They get to decide what the debt is for and how hard it will be to repay.
3. You have been **rivals in the past**. They get to decide what the rivalry was about and how you've set that aside.
4. You have been **dreaming about them**. They get to decide what the dreams are about and how they fit into them.
5. You **worked together**. They get to decide what your working relationship looked like and how you felt about each other.
6. You **admire their abilities**. They get to decide what talents of theirs you admire and how you've been expressing your admiration.

## Ship

Every spacefaring crew needs a ship, and every ship needs an AI. As a group, roll `1d6` four times or choose from the tables below to create your ship, its name, and its personality.

| **1d6** | **Type** | **Condition** |
| ------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 1       | carrier  | battered      |
| 2       | yacht    | creaky        |
| 3       | fighter  | neglected     |
| 4       | clipper  | outdated      |
| 5       | frigate  | shabby        |
| 6       | tanker   | unreliable    |

| **1d6** | **Name** | **Personality traits** |
| ------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| 1       | Nguvu    | aggressive             |
| 2       | Kasi     | enterprising           |
| 3       | Kasa     | genial                 |
| 4       | Simba    | jaded                  |
| 5       | Amani    | protective             |
| 6       | Utulivu  | reckless               |

Every ship is outfitted with an anti-matter-powered positron drive for interplanetary travel, an alpha-rated jump drive for interstellar travel, an alpha-rated cargo container capable of holding 60 units of cargo, and a cryochamber to keep crew from experiencing adverse effects from hyperspace.

Your ship begins with 1d6 breech protection (BP) and is filled with 20 fuel. If you reach 0 BP, then any breech damage your ship takes destroys it. If you reach 0 fuel, then you are adrift.
