# Rules summary

## Actions

At the `start of combat`, each character must make a `DEX save`. Those that succeed get an opportunity to act before the first `round` of combat. During each ten-second round of combat, all characters get to act and then all adversaries follow. All actions take place simultaneously.

On your turn, you can move up to 40ft and take a single `action`. Actions include attacking, casting a spell, moving again, and other activities of similar duration.

You may `retreat` from a dangerous situation with a successful `DEX save` and a safe destination to escape to.

## Abilities

* `STR` — physicality, brawn, and toughness
* `DEX` — speed, ability to sneak, and hand-eye coordination
* `CTRL` — willpower and ability to tolerate the unknown

## Saves

Roll d20 equal to or under your target `ability`. `1` is always a success. `20` is always a failure. The party at most risk in a contested action makes the save.

## Hit protection

`HP` reflects your character’s ability to avoid `stress` and physical `damage`. It is lost during combat and recovered after a few moments of rest.

Taking a short rest restores `1d6 HP`. Sleeping overnight in a safe location restores all `HP` or `1d6` points of ability damage.

## Deprivation

When you are `deprived`, you can't recover `HP`. If you are deprived for more than a day, add `fatigue` to one slot of your inventory for each day you are deprived.

## Inventory

You have ten `inventory slots`. Most items take up one slot, but `small` items can be bundled. `Bulky` items take up two slots and are awkward or difficult to carry. When all ten of your inventory slots are occupied, your `HP` is reduced to `0`.

## Combat

All feasible attacks automatically hit. Roll `stress` or `damage`, subtract any protections from `armor` or `stability`, and deal the remaining total to your opponent’s `HP`.

If there are multiple attackers, or one attacker using multiple weapons, roll all damage dice together and keep the single highest die.

`Impaired` attacks reduce damage and stress to `1d4`. `Enhanced` attacks increase damage and stress to `1d12`. `Blast` affects all area targets, rolling separately for each.

## Damage + stress

`Damage` or `stress` that reduce your target's HP below zero reduces their STR or CTRL by the remainder. If damage, then they must then make a `STR save` to avoid `critical damage`. Failure drops them out of combat, dying if left untreated. If stress, then they must make a `CTRL save` or take `fallout`.

If any of your ability scores are reduced to zero, your character is immediately `retired` from the game. Whether you are dead, incapacitated, or lost to the void is up to you.
