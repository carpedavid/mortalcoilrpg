# Useful equipment

> It’s dangerous out here. Lots of things that don’t take kindly to people like us sticking our heads where they don’t belong. That’s why you have to be prepared for anything, spacefarer. Plan for the worst, hope for the best, isn’t that right? After all, if you want to live forever, you have to live long enough to make it happen.

# Item tags

`Armor` indicates that this item reduces `damage` before it is applied to `HP`.

`Blast` indicates that an attack hits every target within an area. If you use a blast attack, you roll damage or stress separately for each affected target. Roll the attack’s standard damage or stress die to determine the number of targets affected.

`Breech` weapons do physical `damage` to space ships, which reduces their `breech protection` (BP).

`Bulky` items take up two `inventory slots`.

`Damage` indicates that this item causes physical damage when used to attack. The value of the damage is listed next to the tag.

`Modifiable` items can be augmented at a later time with the indicated number of modifications. Unless the modification is `swappable`, it is permanent once made.

`Proximity` indicates that an item is activated by a creature moving within five feet of it.

`Small` items may be combined with other small items in a single `inventory slot`.

`Stability` indicates that this item reduces `stress` before it is applied to `HP`.

`Stress` indicates that this item causes stress when used to attack. The value of the stress is listed next to the tag.

`Swappable` indicates that this modification can be added to or removed from a modifiable item with a bit of time and effort at no additional cost.

# Defense

While you can carry multiple protective items, you can only benefit from one `armor` and one `stability` effect at a time.

## Suits + shields

Suits take one `inventory slot` when worn.

| Item                                          | Cost (cr) |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| Defense shield (+1 armor)                     | 1,000     |
| Hazard suit (+1 armor, modifiable 2)          | 1,000     |
| Inertial armor (+2 armor, modifiable 1)       | 5,000     |
| Pressure suit (+2 armor, bulky, modifiable 3) | 10,000    |
| Vacuum suit (modifiable 3)                    | 500       |

## Suit modifications

Suit modifications occupy the same `inventory slot` as the suit they modify.

| Item                                                    | Cost (cr) |

# Offense

You can carry more than one weapon, but if you attack with multiple weapons at the same time, roll all `damage` or `stress` dice and keep the single highest result.

**Blackthorn rifles** have barrels crafted from blackrock, the valuable mineral that allows physical interaction with spirits of the Negaverse.

**Ghost blades** are forged aluminum with a microscopic layer of blackrock that has been vacuum deposited on the surface.

**Null pistols** fire ammunition loaded with powdered blackrock.

## Explosives

All explosives are single-use items.

# Gear

| Item                            | Cost (cr) |
| ------------------------------- | --------- |
| Article of faith (+1 stability) | —         |
| Bioscanner                      | 500       |
| Exoskeleton                     | 2000      |
| Geoscanner                      | 500       |
| Matter condenser                | 1000      |
| Nanochems x6                    | 1200      |
| Neurolink                       | 800       |
| Reconnaissance drone            | 5000      |
| Replacement organ               | 2000      |
| Secure enclave                  | 200       |
| Universal translator            | 1000      |

**Articles of faith** vary from religion to religion, but most commonly take the form of a small pendant or amulet worn around the neck on a chain.

**Bioscanners** detect the existence of living biological creatures within a 100m radius. They are largely ineffective at detecting undead.

**Exoskeletons** enhance the lifting and carrying capacity of a human being by a factor of ten. They’re used by dock workers and anyone else who needs to move very heavy things on a regular basis.

**Geoscanners** use multi-frequency radar waves to create a navigable 3D map of a 100m radius sphere, centered on the user.

**Matter condensers** allow the user to reduce the physical space occupied by an object. A personal condenser can reduce about one cubic meter of material to one tenth of its current volume.

**Nanochems** are smart, nanobot-powered delivery agents for chemical and biological compounds. They promote healing and restore 1d4 STR per dose.

**Neurolinks** allow humans to directly interface with digital systems, bypassing the need to use any external action to communicate.

**Reconnaissance drones** are capable of mapping and observing targets under their own direction.

**Replacement organs** are sustainably manufactured, ethical replacements for failing human organs.

**Secure enclaves** provide neural-linked, encrypted storage of digital information. To unlock a secure enclave, the user must deliberately think about unlocking it.

**Universal translators** allow for communication between speakers of most human languages.

## Ship weapons + armor

Most civilian ships aren't equipped with weapons or armor. Pirate ships are sometimes equipped with salvaged proton cannons (`1d6 breech`) and inertial dampeners (`+1 armor`). Military ships range from speedy fighters with proton cannons of their own to massive carriers equipped with tactical antimatter torpedoes and singularity howitzers.

To price ship-grade weapons and armor, multiply the cost of an equivalent personal item by `100`.
