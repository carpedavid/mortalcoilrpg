# Rules of the game

> You can’t very well break the rules unless you learn to play by them first, can you, spacefarer?

*This Mortal Coil* and the games it is based on assume that, as a competent character, you can accomplish most tasks given enough time and resources. It’s only when facing challenges like running from a hungry frost grub that’s chasing you across the crevice-scarred ice glaciers of Barafu that failure is truly possible.

The following rules will aid you and your crew in figuring out what happens during those perilous situations.

## Abilities

Each of your three `abilities` is used to make `saves` in specific situations.

* `STR` — Strength is used in instances of physical power and endurance. Physical `damage` targets STR.
* `DEX` — Dexterity is used in instances of speed, subtlety, and precision.
* `CTRL` — Control is used in instances of social interaction, emotional strain, stress, and fallout. `Stress` targets CTRL.

## Saves

A `save` is the resolution mechanic that's used when determining the outcome of an action. Saves are only needed when there is risk involved with failure, so if there is no risk or interesting narrative outcome at stake, you don't need to roll.

To make a save, roll a `d20` against the relevant `ability`. If you roll *equal to or under your ability score*, you pass. Otherwise, you fail. A result of `1` is always a success and a result of `20` is always a failure.

If there is a `contested action`, the party facing the greatest risk makes the save.

## Hit protection

`HP` reflects your character’s ability to avoid `stress` and physical `damage`. It is lost during combat and recovered after a few moments of rest.

### Armor + stability

Your `armor` value is deducted from incoming `damage` before it is applied to your `HP`. Similarly, your `stability` value is deducted from incoming `stress` before it is applied to your `HP`. Equipment (p. XX) provides these defense bonuses.

### Deprivation + fatigue

If you are `deprived` of a crucial need, such as food or rest, you are unable to recover HP or ability scores. You may also become deprived as the result of magical consequences or enemy abilities.

When you are deprived for more than a day, you begin to add `fatigue` to your inventory, one for each day. Each fatigue occupies one `inventory slot` and lasts until you are able to recuperate (such as a full night's rest in a safe spot).

If you do not have an open inventory slot, you must drop an item to make room for fatigue. You can also become `deprived` or suffer `fatigue` through events in the game.

### Healing

Taking a rest for a few moments restores `1d6 HP`. Sleeping overnight in a safe location restores all `HP`, and if your HP is full, then you regain `1d6` points of ability damage (you pick which ability you heal). If you have dedicated medical attention while resting for a week, you fully recover all ability damage.

# Inventory

You have a total of ten `inventory slots` that represent your ability to carry items. Most items take up one slot, but `small` items can be bundled together. `Bulky` items take two slots and are awkward to carry, often requiring two hands.

You cannot carry more items than your inventory allows. You can store additional inventory in your ship, but those items become inaccessible when you are away. You can also utilize your undead thralls to carry items for you.

*When your inventory is full (e.g. you have filled all ten slots), you are temporarily reduced to 0 HP.*

## Ships + vehicles

Your ship (and any other vehicles you own) has `breech protection` (BP). When a ship’s BP reaches 0, it is destroyed by any additional breech damage. BP is only affected by weapons and abilities with the `breech` tag.

## Associates

You can hire `associates` to aid in your travels. To create an associate, roll `3d6` for each ability score, then give them `1d6` HP and a simple weapon (`d6`). Associates cost 50-100 `credits` per day.

## Money

`Credits` are the dominant form of currency throughout the Terran Republic. You have a digital wallet in which your credits are securely stored and which is accessible throughout the Alfajiri system.

# Combat

> Living creatures don't give up their spirits willingly, spacefarer. You have to be subtle, sneaky, maybe even a little bit underhanded. You have to see into their souls, understand their desires, and make them think they're getting the deal of a lifetime.

> If they don't realize the full implications of their choices? Well…you can hardly be blamed for that.

> Of course, if that fails, you have to be prepared to take the direct route.

## Rounds

At the `start of combat`, each crew member must make a `DEX save`. Those that succeed get an opportunity to act before the first `round` of combat. During each ten-second round of combat, all characters get to act and then all adversaries follow. An individual character's actions, attacks, and movements take place simultaneously.

## Actions

As a group, determine in which order each member acts. When it is your turn, you may `move` up to 40 feet and then take one `action`. Actions include casting a spell, attacking, and taking a second move.

You must state what actions you are taking before you roll any dice. If you attempt something risky, the facilitator will call for a `save` from the appropriate party.

## Attacks + damage

As long as an attack is feasible, it automatically hits. The attacker rolls their `damage` die, and then the opponent subtracts any `armor` bonus and applies the remainder to their `HP`. Any excess damage is applied to `STR`.

If an attack deals `stress`, the opponent subtracts any `stability` bonus before applying the remainder to their `HP`. Excess stress is dealt to `CTRL`.

### Attack modifiers

Your attack is `impaired` if you are suffering from a condition or are in a position that would impact your effectiveness. Impaired attacks always roll `1d4` for damage or stress, regardless of the normal value.

On the other hand, your attack is `enhanced` if you are in a position that improves your effectiveness. Enhanced attacks always roll `1d12` for damage or stress, regardless of the normal value.

### Blast

The `blast` quality denotes an attack that hits every target within an area. If you use a blast attack, you roll damage separately for each affected target. If the size of the area is unclear, roll the attack’s standard damage die to determine the number of targets affected.

### Dual weapons

If you attack with two weapons at the same time, roll both damage or stress dice and keep the single highest result.

### Multiple attackers

When you and other members of your crew target a single creature, you roll all `damage` and `stress` dice and keep the single highest result. Similarly, when multiple adversaries target one of you in a single round, the facilitator will roll all damage dice and take only the single highest result.

### Retreat

Escaping a doomed situation requires a successful `DEX` save and a safe destination in order to get away. Safely retreating is a victory in and of itself.

## Critical damage + stress

If `damage` brings your `HP` below zero, your `STR` is decreased by the amount remaining and you must make a `STR save` to avoid taking `critical damage`. Likewise, if `stress` brings your HP below zero, your `CTRL` is decreased by the remaining amount, and you must make a `CTRL save` to avoid taking `critical stress`.

Suffering critical damage `disables` you, rendering you unconscious and immobile. If you do not receive aid and rest within one hour, you die. Suffering critical stress results in taking `fallout`, each instance of which permanently occupies one `inventory slot`.

## Retiring your character

If any of your ability scores are reduced to zero, your character is immediately `retired` from the game. Whether you are dead, incapacitated, or lost to the void is up to you — you may choose how to narrate your final moments.

When all ten of your `inventory slots` are filled with `fallout`, your character is in extreme danger — the next time your character would take fallout, they are immediately retired instead. The corrupting influence of the Negaverse has finally eliminated the last trace of your humanity and your fate has been sealed.

When your character retires, you may create a new character or take control of an associate. Your new character immediately joins the party to minimize downtime.

## Fallout

Whenever you suffer `critical stress`, the energy of the Negaverse gains a foothold over your body. Roll `1d10` or choose one of the following effects, re-rolling any duplicates. Each `fallout` takes up an `inventory slot` and cannot be removed.

1. **Your eyes** melt away, leaving a gaping black void to fill your eye sockets. You can still see, but now you can see in the absence of light.
2. **Your legs** transform into a writhing mass of black cilia. You can still move, but now you can cling to any surface.
3. **Your head** twists 180 degrees. You feel no pain, and you can now perceive the world in front of and behind you simultaneously.
4. **Your bones** elongate. You are now two feet taller than you were, but you’re able to squeeze into spaces no human body should fit into.
5. **Your tongue** swells to three times its size, turns black, and develops a mind of its own. You can still communicate normally, but you no longer need to eat.
6. **Your arms** fade away. You can still touch and manipulate the world around you, but you can also reach through solid matter.
7. **Your skin** blisters and peels off in broad, bloody sheets. You indelibly mark whatever you touch, but you're now immune to the effects of extreme cold and heat.
8. **Your chest** caves in, leaving a gaping void in the middle of your torso. You perpetually feel like you are suffocating, but you no longer need to breathe.
9. **Your nose** rots and falls off, leaving a gaping, weeping hole in the middle of your face. You can now smell the emotional state of any living creature you encounter.
10. **Your mouth** stretches and twists into a horrific, fanged grin. No matter what you do, you can't hide your terrifying smile, but you can now speak directly into the mind of anyone you can see.
